# Benchmarking

## Quick start

### Create the benchmarking data

1. Start with the root of this repository as the current working directory
2. Make sure you have successfully built the repository once e.g. with a simple
   `make` command
3. Set the `DATA` environment variable to where you want to store the
   benchmarking data e.g. `export DATA=/var/srv/data`
4. Start the benchmarking, the shell script below will produce three runs:

   ```sh
   test -d "$DATA" || echo '$DATA is not set properly'
   path="$PWD"
   cd "$DATA"
   date &&
   seq 1 5 | while read i ; do
     test -d "$i" || git clone "$path" "$i" || break
     test -d "$i/src-SQLite" || git -C "$i" clone "$path/src-SQLite" || break
     test -d "$i/src-lmdb" || git -C "$i" clone "$path/src-lmdb" || break
     make -C "$i" benchmark || break
   done &&
   date
   ```

### Summarise and publish the benchmarking data

The steps below summarise and publish the benchmarking results on GitHub pages.
This process use Node JS and a JavaScript framework called svelte:

- Make sure you have Node JS 12 or higher installed, the [official instructions]
  may help
- Run `npm install` in this `benchmarking` directory

Each time you wish to produce a table, set the `DATA` environment variable to
where you want to store the benchmarking data e.g. `export DATA=/var/srv/data`,
as above.

Then start with this directory, `benchmarking`, as the current directory:

```sh
test -d "$DATA" || echo '$DATA is not set properly'
npx sapper dev                      # check everything looks OK
test -d gh-pages || git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
npm run gh-pages
cd gh-pages
python3 -m http.server           # check it looks good or another http server
git commit
git push
```

Exporting the `TITLE` environment variable changes the title and heading text in
the HTML.

Note that if data is left set then the tests on the JavaScript code will fail â€”
`unset DATA`.

## Terminology

1. Several runs make up a data **set**
2. A **run** includes separate reports on different versions, it can be
   represented as a directory
3. A **report** shows the results of different tests for a single version, it
   can be represented as an HTML file
4. This benchmarking compares different **versions** for example upstream SQLite
   3.7.17 is a version
5. Comparisons are made across different **tests**, tests typically have a name
   and a value

## Design choices

This benchmarking project:

- uses ES Modules where possible
- avoids a module bundler like "rollup" as much as possible for simplicity
- has 100% test coverage for `src/utils/`
- formats everything with https://prettier.io
- checks JavaScript and Svelte code with https://eslint.org

## Prerequisites

- Node JS >= 12, for ES Modules support

## Tests

### Dependencies

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for unit tests and
[Cypress](https://cypress.io) for integration tests. The following commands
should set up the dependencies on Fedora 31:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade --assumeyes &&
sudo dnf install --assumeyes \
  nodejs gtk3 alsa-lib nss libXScrnSaver libcanberra-gtk3 &&
sudo npm install -g npm &&
npm ci
```

If all dependencies are installed, `npm test` will run both the unit and
integration tests.

Mocha's support for ES Modules is a
[work in progress](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4038). The version of
mocha specified in `package.json` is an experimental release with support for ES
Modules.

These instructions were tested in a
[toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox):

```sh
toolbox create --release 31 &&
toolbox enter --release 31
```

It is necessary to set configure the display as an environment variable:

```sh
export DISPLAY=":0"
```

If you forget to configure the display, you will receive an errors starting
with:

```
Your system is missing the dependency: Xvfb
```

These instructions were tested with:

```sh
$ node --version
v12.15.0
$ npm --version
6.13.4
```

</details>

### Unit tests

```sh
npm run unit
npm run unit:debug
```

### Integration tests

Check the `DISPLAY` environment variable is set then run the tests:

```sh
npx sapper build
npm run integration-tests
```

<details>

Behind the scenes that `integration-tests` script uses
[start-server-and-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/start-server-and-test) to
run a server and the tests. To perform these steps separately and run the tests
against the development server run the two commands below in separate terminals:

```sh
npx sapper dev
npx cypress run
```

To debug integration tests try:

```sh
npx cypress open
```
