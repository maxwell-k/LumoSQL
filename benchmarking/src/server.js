         *
         * > The "url" argument must be of type string. Received type object
         *
         * This error is caused because the html files in ./static/ do not
         * include the base tag that %sapper.base% adds. Without the correct
         * base tag, base_match in node_modules/sapper/dist/export.js is always
         * null, causing a call equivalent to:
         *
         * require('url').resolve("http://localhost:3000/test/test.html", null)
         *
         * As a workaround this function sets the content type to "text/html;
         * charset=UTF-8" and therefore avoids the calls to resolve.
         *
         * To be effective this workaround needs the change in
